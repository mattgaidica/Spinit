Spinit is a realtime application that has provides mobile quizes and provides a realtime dashboard including geolocation and quiz score. It's purpose was to test the dynamics of grouped quizzing, likely in a higher-ed situation. Since the dashboard dropped pins onto a Google map in realtime, and the student's photos appeared (via Facebook login) with their quiz status, it became interesting to watch as a simulated class completes a questionnaire/quiz.
